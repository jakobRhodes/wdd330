<h1> Notes </h1>
<ul>
<li>"Programmer errors are our responsibility, so we must ensure
    they are minimized as much as possible and fixed promptly."</li><br>
<li>
    "It might even be argued that user errors are in fact also
programmer errors, because the program should be designed in a way that
prevents the user from making the error.""
</li><br>
<li>Stack trace - a sequence of functions or
    method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.</li><br>
<li> "If a warning occurs, the JavaScript will continue to run (although possibly
    incorrectly)."</li><br>
<li> "ensure that the code they write fails
    loudly in development so any errors can be identified and fixed quickly."</li><br>
<li>"Strict mode encourages a better quality of
    JavaScript to be written"</li><br>
<li>Strict mode simply requires the following string to be added to the first line of a
    JavaScript file:
    'use strict';</li><br>
<li>"Linting tools
    are also useful for enforcing a programming style guide."</li><br>
