<h1> Notes </h1>

<li>"The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew
    any element on the page."</li><br>
<li>
    "The scale(x,y) function scales an elementbythe defined factors horizontallythen
    vertically."
</li><br>
<li>"The order of transform functions does matter: if you rotate before translating,
    your translate direction will be on the rotated axis."</li><br>
<li> "Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially
    providing simple animations."</li><br>
<li> "Here are the steps to create a simple transition using only CSS:
    1. Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.
    2. Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.
    3. Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the
    transition properties, including: transition-property, transition-duration,
    transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. We’ll look at each of
    these and how they work shortly"</li><br>
<li>"With HTML5’s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through
    JavaScript. This can improve the performance of our websites by avoiding the need
    to download images off the network."</li><br>
<li>"A major downside of canvas in its current form is its lack of accessibility. The canvas
    doesn’t create a DOM node, is not a text-based format, and is thus essentially invisible to tools such as screen readers."
    'use strict';</li><br>
<li>"SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file
    format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML. A major selling point
    of vector graphics in general is that, unlike bitmap images (such as GIF, JPEG, PNG,
    and TIFF), vector images preserve their quality even as you blow them up or shrink
    them down. "</li><br>
